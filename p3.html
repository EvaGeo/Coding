        <h1>Hopscotch: A Tale of Home</h1>
        <h2>Interview conducted by Cristina Cărcănescu</h2>
        <p1>
    I was born 4 years, 4 months, and 21 days after the revolution, the event that divides the history of Romania and of most former socialist countries in before and after. The apartment that was built before became my home after. 
	For so long I have been in conflict with the walls, doors and tiles of my apartment and the system that brought them into existence. The only condition which made it a home was to provide shelter. Little had I known that shelter for one’s thoughts, dreams, conversations, childhood meant home. <br>
        </p1><br>
        <p1>
    The whole family relocated in the autumn of 1983, approximately six months after acquiring the apartment. Moving to Bucharest seemed a reasonable decision, as my grandfather was the only one sustaining the family at the time and had already been working on construction sites since 1964. This undoubtedly triggered a dynamic shift from a traditional to a modern family. Moving also ensured better access to education and exposure to a greater palette of stimuli for the children (my father and aunt). The most interesting transformation was the one of my grandmother. Even though she moved to take care of her house and children, she was no longer a homemaker. She would work as hard as my grandfather, since it was difficult in the city to have the same occupation one used to have in the village.<br>

    Conversations between my grandmother (Elena), father (Ion), and mother (Mariana), under the guidance of my questions, written while at 2,806 km West.

            <pe>E: I didn’t know any of them, your father knew them… Nicu…</pe><br>
            <pm>M: Were they a part of the… Were they construction colleagues?</pm>
            <pe>E: Construction. Colleagues.</pe>
            <pi>I: Moldovans.</pi>
            <pm>M&E (in unison): Workers, they were simply workers.</pm>
            <pm>M: Like father, no?</pm>
            <pe>E: Yes.</pe>
            <pm>M: And were they not coming from... Daughter says here what kind of background did they have? Well, they had the same background as…</pm>
            <pe>E: Construction, all of them were builders. And are you filming me now? Well if I am looking at Mariana, what are you filming?</pe>
            <pi>I: It doesn’t matter, you face Mariana.</pi>
            <pm>M: You just have to talk, not do anything else.</pm>
            <pe>E: Oh, yes?</pe>
            <pm>M: It goes on like this: “Was there a community in the block?” What does she want to say with this? Is she referring to the dwellers’ association?</pm>
            <pi>I: I guess.. It was an organisation, not necessarily a community. An association</pi>
            <pe>E: …yes, it was the association of the block inhabitants.</pe>
            <pm>M: It also says if there were any meetings, where would they take place, under what…</pm>
            <pe>E: It was a weekly meeting, at the entrance of the block, on the ground level. The meeting with the neighbours, the issues that wew bothering us, the issues of the block. We never went to anyone’s. It was only that one time, you had already moved in, when he invited some people, but he got over it quickly because I told him that if he is ever going to bring anyone else into the house I will chase them out, including him.</pe>
            <pm>M: Daughter also asks if you would dine together, or whether you would exchange recipes of anything.</pm>
            <pe>E: We didn’t use to dine with anyone. We would only go to Mitică who would offer him only one glass of țuică and then when we would be about to leave, his wife Lenuța would give him another one. And every time we had them over, they would drink one kilo…</pe>
            <pm>M: They were not welcome from your part anymore.</pm>
            <pe>E: No way! Until one day, when I told him: “Mircea, can’t you see how they fool you?” You go there, Lenuța gives you a tiny glass of țuică, while we talk, stay for a couple of hours and then, right when you’re about to leave, in front of the door, “nenea Mirică, have another glass!” I would nudge him to stop and leave at once, because I would feel fooled by them, and then, when they would visit us, your father would take out the whole bottle and Mitică would not leave unless it was empty.</pe>
            <pi>I: Let’s disregard Mitică, he was not living in the same block. He was from across the street.</pi>
            <pm>M: So in the same block, you wouldn’t meet with anyone.</pm>
            <pe>E: We wouldn’t.</pe>
            <pm>M: After that what was the opportunity to spend time outside? Would you go outside? In front of the block? Would you spend time in the garden?</pm>
            <pe>E: I would not go. When the children were at our place and I had to take care of them, I would take them for a stroll…</pe>
            <pm>M: Did the front garden have any purpose at all?</pm>
            <pi>I: Not really.</pi>
            <pe>E: No purpose, they used to plant flowers.</pe>
            <pi>I: And people would throw cigarette buds from above.</pi>
            <pm>M: So you weren’t spending as much time outside in the end.</pm>
            <pe>E: No, not at all. I would go to work and then come back.</pe>
            <pm>M: So, was the balcony as it is nowadays, when you first moved in?</pm>
            <pe>E: Same like nowadays. But it was open, we closed it later.</pe>
            <pm>M: What’s the purpose of the balcony now? And what did it use to serve for?</pm>
            <pe>E: To dry clothes. And to store pickled cabbage…</pe>
            <pm>M: Was is a space for leisure, or were you treating it solely as a cellar, a porch, a courtyard?</pm>
            <pe>E: It was…</pe>
            <pi>I: It was both a basement and a veranda. During wintertime it was a cellar and in the summer it was a veranda.</pi>
            <pe>E: I would go there and knit, or sew, or sit on a chair, put my sewing machine there, so I would have fresh air. See the street and the garden, I would use to work in between drying clothes, jars with pickled vegetables, sacks of potatoes, everything was stored there. It was very useful…</pe>
            <pm>M: Was it a relaxations oasis?</pm>
            <pe>E: I would get angry for it not being bigger, there was not enough space for all the clothes, it was too small! We were a lot of people and I had to put clothes to dry, and back in the day, we didn’t have a washing machine that would dry them, like you do nowadays.</pe>
            <pm>M: Moving on, were the “debarale” simple spaces for storage, or tiny workshops?</pm>
            <pe>E: No, we would only use it for storage. We would put jars there.</pe>
            <pm>M: Moving on, what daughter asks furthermore… She says: “The heart of the house, where would the inhabitants of the house spend most of the time?”</pm>
            <pi>I: In the kitchen.</pi>
            <pm>M: …was it the kitchen? If so, why?</pm>
            <pe>E: To cook. What do you mean, why?</pe>
            <pm>M: Why would you spend most time precisely in the kitchen?</pm>
            <pi>I: You wouldn’t even have a TV for you to watch something.</pi>
            <pe>E: Eh, we wouldn’t have a TV. We had one…</pe>
            <pi>I: Yes, we had, but there was nothing to watch.</pi>
            <pe>E: Yes, the programme would end at ten back then.</pe>
            <pm>M: Would you talk, tell stories, play cards or just eat?</pm>
            <pe>E: We would eat…</pe>
            <pi>I: And talk about our day.</pi>
            <pe>E: We would wash the dishes. Your father-in-law would have a beer in the meantime, what else…</pe>
            <pm>M: In the end, where was the heart of the house? Where would the centre be, where would people gather…</pm>
            <pe>E: Well, in the kitchen, and afterwards in the room where we would watch television. In the living room when we would sit and watch something on the Tv.</pe>
            <pm>M: Nelu, do you understand what your daughter is trying to ask?</pm>
            <pi>I: Yes, the kitchen. Because it was warm, especially in the winter.</pi>
            <pm>M: You know better, you lived there under Ceaușescu’s rule. Was there any moment in time when the living room, or any other chamber, was a “odaie bună”, locked under a key, where all the valuable furniture, new rugs were being kept?</pm>
            <pe>E: I used to keep in the living room everything else that was newer, more pristine, most valuable to us, since the bedrooms were for sleeping.</pe>
            <pm>M: So, in the apartment, the proper room was considered to be the living room…</pm>
            <pe>E: Yes, the living room. Yes, but other people would use the living room daily. For example, the bourgeoisie would eat in the living room; they wouldn’t dine in the kitchen like we did. Some others would gather in the living room, dine with friends. But if you take me for example, born and brought up in the countryside, still a peasant, and since I have never been too keen on having guests over, we would only dine in the kitchen. But, for example, when I heard the girls at work talking, they were serving food in the kitchen, as well.</pe>
            <pm>M: Now, there have been so many people, moving in, moving out of your house. Did you feel at home in the apartment? Or was it just a transitional space? Did you consider this house as a home…</pm>
            <pe>E: Of course! I used to love it there as well. I was with my children, they used to go to school there, it was my home. For such a long time, eighteen years, and afterwards I came back here because I had no other choice.</pe>
            <pm>M: So daughter asks: “Was it a home or a transitional space, a pathfinder, did it offer a shelter to people in need, only for the time needed? How was it different from the house in the village? Was one more of a home than the other?”</pm>
            <pe>E: When I was living in Bucharest, I liked it there, when I moved back here, I used to cry all the time. I moved back here, and then I got used to everything once again and I wouldn’t leave this place now. I got used here, with my hens, my dogs, with everything!</pe>
            <pm>M: So you left this place to go to Bucharest, so your children would have more opportunities…</pm>
            <pe>E: For my children to have a better place where to learn, have a better future, and for me to be near to them while they were studying… I wanted to benefit from something, as well; to provide for the family, as well. It’s better at the countryside now. There we used to sit in a queue all the time… especially since Nelu was in the army and I had to buy a piece of meat so I would send it to him. Even Mitu said back then that he only has fried meat whenever we’re about to go and visit Nelu in the army. I would fry a big pan of meat, pack some for Nelu, and leave the rest for them. Well, if I queued every day… So yes, while I was there I liked it there and I would not feel like home here anymore, but when I moved back here, here it was more like home; home here and home there.</pe>
