            TRANSCENDENTAL HOMELESSNESS<br>
            The pensive term transcendental homelessness – coined by Gyorgy Lukacs in his 1916 “Theory of the Novel” – refers to the longing for a place in which the human soul has once belonged. Everyone has a profound sense that they once belonged somewhere, yet this place has been lost, giving purpose to human life to reclaim a lost site of existence. The struggle ensues when this urge cannot be fulfilled. Eastern European homelessness is not just the result of deracination or nostalgia, but a permanent condition established due to this region’s positioning between Western Europe and Asia , a buffer zone that displaces the soul, hinders modernisation, and makes the subject feel exiled in perpetuity.
        </p>
        <p>
            THE LOVE BOAT HAS CRASHED AGAINST BYT<br>
            So reads Vladimir Mayakovsky’s suicide note whose famously enigmatic verse bears testimony that trifles of everyday life usually prevail. The Russian word byt – deemed untranslatable into European languages by Roman Jakobson – makes direct reference to the daily grind, the radical alterity of everyday. If originally it was the Symbolists that used byt to describe the empire of routine, the ordinary way of life soon began to be widely regarded as the order of chaos that precludes illumination. Through this poetic demonisation of daily transience without transcendence, the failure to surpass banality includes both guilt and anxiety, a scare that the revolutionary dreams of radical construction would be forgotten.        </p>

        <p>
            THE MONSTROUS EAST<br>
            Is it really accidental that the most lasting Western mythological villains, from Frankenstein to Count Dracula, Nosferatu to the Golem are connected somehow to Eastern Europe? Of course, the fact that the demonisation of Eastern Europe is a socio-historical construct is not surprising any longer. Following this monstrous regionality, Eastern Europe seems to be abundant in folk and mythological creatures which have gradually led to a schizophrenic construction of Eastern Europe as the birthplace of evil: the hideous and the frightful, vampirism and lycanthropy, witchcraft and black magic, diabolic rites and cruel customs, occultists and satanists, demons and fiends, spooks and ghosts, lesbian femmes fatales and dangerous temptresses. This source of gothic horrors and Westernised otherness ranges from “Mare” – the Slavic creature of bad dreams, bringer of nightmares to “Bozalosc” – the messanger of death, or from “Bobak” – the Polish boogeyman, to the Albanian “Bolla”– whose eyes remain sealed throughout the year, except for St. George’s Day, when it gazes into the world, devouring any human on sight.
        </p>

        <p>
            THE PARTIZANKA & THE AFZ<br>
            The weapon of struggle knows no sex, class, or ethnicity. Especially when it is aimed at fascists and it is held by women. The Women’s Antifascist Front of Yugoslavia (AFZ) was an interwar and World War II-era feminist movement and political organisation. The “partizanka” played a key role in the war effort, with two million women being involved in the communist-led resistance. This new condition subsequently destabilised social arrangements, giving way for renewed possibilities of altering existing notions of gender, nation, family. The oscillating trajectory of the “partizanka”, however, mirrored the accomplishments and erosion of Yugoslav communism and the Yugoslav nation itself: tracing her journey, we notice that she started out as the energetic revolutionary par excellence – celebrated publicly through commemorations and historiographies – only to crumble and end up as a marginalised relic of the past. What can we derive from the collapse of a nation’s icon is that feminist solidarity can be truly empowering only when women reach out directly to other women, and not when their actions are conditioned by male mediators.        </p>
   

        <p>
            GOING TO AMERICA<br>
            There is a radical difference between the European dream and the American dream: interhuman connections over individual autonomy, a sense of community over the private pursuit of happiness, diversity and openness over assimilation and consumption, regional and international cooperation over a unilateral application of power, revolution which will radically transfigure the social world over a self-perpetuating system. It is therefore not surprising that in “Crime and Punishment”, Dostoevsky comes up with a new way of thinking about the New World and the land of promises, when he uses the phrase “going to America” as a synonym to “committing suicide”.

 <h1>Plopeasa under OMV’s Influence</h1>
 <h2>Text by Eva Georgescu</h2>


 <p>
  

Introduction <br><br>

In the post-communist era, Romania opened its doors to foreign investment as part of a broader strategy to modernise its economy and align with Western institutions. One of the most consequential moves in this transformation was the 2004 privatisation of Petrom, the country’s largest oil company, sold to the Austrian conglomerate OMV. Touted as a step toward depoliticisation and economic reform, this deal has revealed deep contradictions in the promise of global capitalism. The case of Plopeasa, a village rich in natural resources, provides a sobering microcosm of the costs of this transition. Once a thriving community sustained by oil-related employment and agricultural practices, Plopeasa has suffered depopulation, infrastructural collapse, and environmental degradation, all under the shadow of OMV Petrom's operations. This essay explores how OMV’s activities in Plopeasa not only reflect but also exacerbate the erosion of rural Romanian life, transforming a once self-sustaining village into a site of ecological strain and socio-economic abandonment.<br>


<br><br><br><br>OMV: Between Austria and Romania<br><br>

OMV Petrom is Southeastern Europe’s largest integrated energy producer, operating across the entire energy value chain—from oil and gas exploration and production to refining, fuel distribution, power generation, and gas and electricity marketing (OMV
Petrom, n.d.).

<br>Petrom was founded in 1991 by the Romanian government, following the fall of communism in 1989, and consisted of multiple gas and oil companies, focusing on drilling in domestic oil fields, operating refineries, and distributing fuel. In the 1990s, Petrom was often used by politicians to secure political favours, leading to inefficiencies and financial losses. This practice was part of a broader pattern of state capture and clientelism in Romania's state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Political appointments to key positions within Petrom were frequently based on political affiliation rather than professional qualifications, undermining the company's governance and operational efficiency. Such political interference resulted in poor management decisions, misallocation of resources, and a lack of accountability. (Volintiru et al., 2018) <br>

<br>Additionally, Petrom, like many other SOEs in Romania, engaged in unscheduled and unjustified procurement processes, often without competitive tendering. These practices facilitated corruption and rent-seeking behaviour, further exacerbating the company's financial difficulties. There were instances where procurement was conducted outside the Public Acquisition Approval Procedure. (PAAP), leading to overvalued purchases and financial mismanagement (Volintiru et al., 2018). <br>

<br>These issues led to Romania’s decision to privatise Petrom in 2004 by selling 51% of stakes to Austria’s OMV Group to depoliticise and invest in the company’s infrastructure. This transaction marked the largest privatisation deal in Romania's history at that time. In reality, the erosion of Petrom’s infrastructure was a gateway to justifying a low selling price for the company. The Petrom sale was urged by the necessity to obtain the ‘functioning market economy status’ from the EU Commission and to close all negotiation chapters by the end of 2004 (Hunya, 2007). Following the acquisition, the company was rebranded as OMV Petrom in 2010,
reflecting its integration into the OMV Group (Adevarul, 2010). <br>

<br>In an interview from 2022, Austrian politician Peter Pilz (Austrian Green Party) admitted that the privatisation of Petrom was a huge corruption hoax benefiting the Austrians (Hendrik, 2022). Critics of the Petrom privatisation deal argue that Austria exploited a developing country by seizing control of its natural resources. Globalisation in Eastern Europe has largely been defined by post-1989 efforts to catch up with international mythology. While Eastern Europe remained stuck and isolated, the West positioned itself as open and adaptable, wielding a powerful tool: an insatiable drive to explore and adopt foreign ideas and narratives (Mogoș, 2019). This created the perfect conditions for developed nations like Austria to exploit newly capitalist, developing countries. <br>

<br>Major Romanian newspapers published articles condemning the privatisation, claiming that last-minute, unpublicised decisions transferred all of Romania’s oil and gas reserves to Petrom just before the contract was signed. This move, they argued, effectively handed over control of the country’s national resources and therefore its independence to foreign interests. As a result, OMV Petrom holds a de facto monopoly over Romania’s oil production. Additionally, the privatisation contract did not include price control clauses, allowing petroleum extracted in Romania to be sold domestically at the same price as imported fuel. This has led to widespread criticism that Romanians are being charged import prices for their natural resources. (Higgins, 2016). <br>

<br>Recently, OMV found itself at the centre of another controversy, this time involving the European Union’s solidarity tax on windfall profits. In 2023, the company initially argued that it might be exempt from the tax and refused to pay. However, it was later confirmed that they were indeed obligated to contribute. Despite this, OMV ultimately paid a reduced amount due to legislative changes that appeared to be tailored specifically to benefit the company (Bursa, 2023). <br>

<br>I would argue that manipulation goes beyond donations to NGOs or compliance with the solidarity tax, as it is embedded in OMV Petrom’s brand identity. One key example is its use of Romania’s national flag colours, even though only 21% of the company is state-owned (MarketScreener, n.d.). Would using Austria’s red and white make it clearer to Romanian citizens that their oil and gas are being sold back to them at the import prices? <br>

<br>The wolf, a symbol of bravery and dominance in Romanian culture, represents a powerful figure in the animal kingdom. OMV Petrom leverages this imagery to position itself as a leader in its industry, portraying the company as dynamic and authoritative.
Culturally, this contributes to a phenomenon of (auto)colonisation, where the post-communist Eastern country internalises the Western perspective of its communist history, to mark overcoming past events and integrating into (Western) normality (Poenaru, 2014). The Romanian branch of the Austrian-owned company seeks to position itself through the western gaze, by accepting the company’s post-communist history and reaffirming its ‘Dacian’ identity. <br>


<br><br><br><br>Plopeasa: A Matter of Time <br>

<br>Plopeasa is a small village in Buzău County, located in the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains. Its grounds host rich reserves of oil and natural gas, and the area has a long-standing history of extraction, most notably after the privatisation of the national oil company (Rompetrol, and later Petrom) was established in 2004. <br>

<br>In 2021, a census of the population shows that Plopeasa was officially home to 244 registered residents (City Population, n.d.). According to a resident of Plopeasa (M. Crăciun, personal communication, July 2024), the village brought together a bustling community, drawing in workers for the oil company OMV, which was exploiting the local oil reserves. Crăciun has told me that back then (in the early 2010s), the village was home to around a thousand inhabitants, and that the local community was vibrant; the residents would usually meet up at the local community centre, and that there would even be summer camps for children. <br>

<br>Upon visiting the area myself in 2024, it is evident that there are currently far fewer inhabitants of this space. In just a decade, Plopeasa emptied. Much of this change can be attributed to a lack of infrastructure and work opportunities. While there is no recent public data about the status of the oil reserves, Crăciun told me that over time, however, OMV Petrom depleted some of the oil reserves and automated extraction processes, leading to massive layoffs. With few job prospects left, locals were forced to seek work elsewhere. Many residents left Romania altogether, finding work in the same industry abroad, mainly in Italy, Spain, or Germany. As a consequence of migration towards bigger cities in the area, the local school has closed, forcing the few remaining families with children to relocate (M. Crăciun, personal communication, July 2024). <br>


<br><br><br><br>Ramifications of the Industrial Capitalist Machine <br>

<br>Companies like OMV Petrom disrupt the small rural communities they enter. While petroleum extraction can create jobs, these opportunities are often short-lived and highly specialised. As oil reserves deplete or extraction becomes automated, the<br>
need for workers disappears, leading to a pattern known as the Boom & Bust cycle.

<br>Today, most of Plopeasa’s remaining residents are elderly and struggling to maintain their homes and land. Many are either too poor or too old to care for one another. They rely heavily on support from their grown children, who live in nearby cities and bring them food and essential supplies (M. Crăciun, personal communication, July 2024). <br>

<br>Although there is barely any literature studying the effects of industrial capitalism (oil extraction companies) on rural communities, there is empirical evidence that I gathered while discussing with members of the community from Plopeasa. During an online conversation, Burlacu gradually reveals to me the symptoms of living near oil extraction (G. Burlacu, personal communication, October 2024). <br>

<br>I have asked about how she thinks the presence of OMV in the area is impacting the community. She has told me that previously there has been a landslide in a different village, and that the heavy equipment destroys the roads in the village, but that she thinks the good outcome is the fact that there are new job opportunities (G. Burlacu, personal communication, October 2024).<br>


<br>Oil extraction also produces wastewater containing chemicals, heavy metals, and salts, posing a serious threat to communities that rely on agriculture and farming. The population is potentially exposed to oil extraction-related contamination through residence in areas where oil extraction is conducted, especially in low and middle-income countries (O’Callaghan-Gordo et al., 2016). However, there is a gap in literature and research measuring the biomarkers of exposure and effect and studying the health risks associated with residential exposure to oil-related contamination. <br>

<br>In Plopeasa, where there is no running water, residents depend on public wells to collect water. She mentioned that there is little drinking water because the salts and chemicals in the wastewater infiltrate the water in the wells. However, only a few wells remain uncontaminated and drinkable, creating a supply shortage. Burlacu said that there was an examination of the waters, and the experts suggested that they should not consume this water, because the level of nitrates is far above the admissible limit. This scarcity has fostered a survivalist mentality, where people rush to secure as much water as possible for their households, sometimes leaving others without access to clean water. (G. Burlacu, personal communication, October 2024). <br>


<br><br><br><br>Conclusion <br>

<br>The story of Plopeasa is not just about a village in decline, it is about the broader implications of allowing multinational corporations to extract value from vulnerable regions without reinvestment in local communities. OMV Petrom’s presence in Plopeasa demonstrates how privatisation and resource exploitation can destabilise rural life, particularly when national interests are subordinated to foreign ownership and short-term economic gains. As oil reserves deplete and automated extraction technologies replace human labor, the temporary economic benefits vanish, leaving behind contaminated environments, failing infrastructure, and displaced populations. While Romania may have gained international legitimacy through the privatisation of its energy sector, the lived reality in villages like Plopeasa suggests that this came at a profound social and ecological cost. Addressing these impacts requires not only more equitable corporate practices but also a reevaluation of how post-communist transitions are managed, and who ultimately bears their burdens.<br>
